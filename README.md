# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview 
This repo contains several different maps built with JavaScript and HTML that utilize Mapbox api, a location data service, and code from Leaflet, a JavaScript library.
### Maps
<font size='0.5'> *There are many different styles utilized in these maps and some contain an option to select a different style in the html.*</font>
#### Practice Maps include the following:
* A Simple Map, used as a base
* Simply City and Population Map
* Simple Line Map running through the coordinates of selected airports
* A GeoJSON Map marking and describing airports throughout the world
* A GeoJSON Map indicating flight paths from a single airport
* A GeoJSON Map using polygons to isolate neighborhoods and their coresponding populations
#### Challenge Maps includes the following:
* A Map displaying earthquakes for the past week
* The Second Map expanding on the first and adding tectonic plate lines and an isolated display of the major earthquakes around the globe
## Results
The maps listed above offer great foundational information that can be utilized in crafting more advance mapping systems for data analysis. The most advanced map, the second map under challenge maps, combines many of the techniques seen in the practice maps to craft a detailed look at earthquake activity around the world. 
### Recomendation
For a map like this, adding a method for selecting specific groupings of earthquakes based on magnitude, instead of just isolating the largest, may make for a more comprehensive and user friendly experience of the data.
